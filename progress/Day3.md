## The Work
I was reccomended a book called "Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools" by a friend and realized its just over
1000 pages......

Anyways, before i do any more development im going to dive headfirst into this monolith and figure out what the hell is 
going on, because I was taught that before any coding is done you must understand the problem. And i sure dont, not yet at least.

This development process will be completed in stages and the first stage is lexical analysis. So that is what ill be tackling first.
I may even redesign the layout of my token class since i want to be 100% sure on all my designs and make everything as bullet proof as I 
can, or at least try to. Again, this is all for fun and is a learning experience so i fully expect to make some questionable design decisions.

So begins STAGE 1: LEXICAL ANALYSIS, wish me luck
