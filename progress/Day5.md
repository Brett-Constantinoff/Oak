## The Work

The lexer now recognizes what i call 'dual operators' which in my mind are just operators that are 2 characters long so things like
!=, <=, >= etc. I also cleaned up the code a bit, added some comments and some new helper methods to limit code duplication. I did
add some preprocessor directives also which i think cleans things up and makes things a bit more readable.
